Using the Truffle Console
--------------------------
I have been able to predetermine what a smart contract address will be without actually
deploying the smart contract, all this works well from the truffle console and remix using
the alfajores.

Using the Web3
----------------
When I tried to interact with the contract using the web3, I was able to predict the
contract address, but if I should deploy the contract, the returnValues address which is
suppose to be the deployed predicted contract address is not correct, I often get this
(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000), not sure what am doing wrong here.
